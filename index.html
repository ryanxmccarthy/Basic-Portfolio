      <p>I am a 24 year old full-stack developer living in Durham, North Carolina. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, and React.</p>

      <p>In my free time, I enjoy hiking, powerlifting and reading. I have a pit bull / lab mix named Vlad, who also enjoys hiking, but does not enjoy powerlifting or reading. I also have a passion for both listening to and playing music, especially metal.</p>
